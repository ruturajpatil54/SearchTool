SearchTool
==========

  SearchTool is simple java & mysql based tool to search files on given drive/folder. In most of Linux file managers,
  the built-in search function is very slow & inaccurate. Therefore SearchTool is designed to search within all 
  specified folders quickly with the help of mysql.
  
  All files are listed and indexed in a mysql database. Any changes to files in indexed locations are identified using
  a system call and they're reflected in the mysql database.
  
  User queries are processed through this database.
